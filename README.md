# Libraries
Assistant UI: https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/getting-started 

AmGraph: https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/getting-started/integrations/react/

## Notes
- Import statements for Assistant UI aren't entirely accurate when installing it into an existing React.js project. May have to edit them to accurately reflect the components' location in src/components or src/components/ui
- The agent's message is its own component. It's able to display components such as buttons and graphs.
